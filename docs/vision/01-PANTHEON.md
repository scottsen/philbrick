## Poetry for the Ages

### On George A. Philbrick
*Before silicon, before modular was music,
there was a quiet man who believed circuits
should not be caged in solder and steel.
He broke the op-amp from its cradle,
cast it into plug-in form, and whispered:
"Let electronics be modular."
Every block you build, every slot you define—
the old prophet smiles, for his idea lives again.*

### On Harold Black
*Everyone knows amplification makes things louder.
But Black realized amplification could make things perfect.
He tamed chaos with its own reflection,
bound noise with its own tail,
and taught electrons to obey.*

### On Claude Shannon
*He weighed meaning in bits,
measured uncertainty with entropy,
found perfection hidden inside chaos.
Where others heard static, Shannon heard structure.
He created the digital world.*
