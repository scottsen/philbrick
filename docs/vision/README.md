**The Big Picture**

Core insight, fundamental ideas, and what makes Philbrick unique:
- Computation = Composition
- Analog = Nature's Computation
- Substrate Agnostic Abstraction
- The endgame use case

**Start here** if you're new to Philbrick.

### [01-PANTHEON.md](01-PANTHEON.md)
**Giants Whose Shoulders We Stand On**

The historical lineage and pioneers who created the foundations:
- **George A. Philbrick** - Modular analog computing (1952) - **Our Spiritual Ancestor**
- Lee de Forest - Amplification (triode, 1906)
- Harold Black - Negative feedback (1927)
- Claude Shannon - Information theory (1948)
- Alan Turing - Universal computation (1936)
- Robert Moog - Voltage-controlled modularity (1964)
- Rupert Neve - Musical electronics

Each layer of Philbrick honors a pioneer.

### [03-MORPHOGEN-BRIDGE.md](03-MORPHOGEN-BRIDGE.md)
**How Morphogen and Philbrick Mirror Each Other**

The architectural connection between software (Morphogen) and hardware (Philbrick):
- Layer-by-layer mapping
- Shared primitives across substrates
- Where digital struggles, analog shines (and vice versa)
- The hybrid sweet spot
- Integration points and workflows

**Read this** to understand how the two platforms work together.

## Key Themes

### Historical Legitimacy
We're not inventing from scratch - we're reviving George A. Philbrick's profound vision of modular analog computing with modern technology.

### Substrate Agnostic
Modules can be pure analog, pure digital, analog-neural, hybrid, or future exotic technologies. The interface makes them interchangeable.

### Four Primitives
Like DNA's 4 bases creating all life, Philbrick uses 4 operations to create all signal processing:
1. Summation
2. Integration
3. Nonlinearity
4. Events

### The Morphogen Connection
Philbrick (hardware) and Morphogen (software) are sister projects - two reflections of the same deep architecture in different media. They share:
- The same compositional philosophy
- The same four primitives
- The same focus on emergence over specialization

## The Elevator Pitch

> *"Philbrick is a modular analog/digital hybrid computing platform where simple primitives compose into complex continuous-time systems. Named after George A. Philbrick who invented modular analog computing in 1952, it's LEGO for continuous-time computation."*

---

*"The universe computes in analog. We model it in Morphogen. We embody it in Philbrick. This is the full circle."*
