# The Four Primitives: DNA of Computational Systems

## The Universal Truth

> "The human body has four instructions and does some pretty cool stuff."
> — referring to DNA's four bases: A, C, G, T

Complex systems are built from shockingly simple primitives. This is true across **every domain:**

| Domain | Primitives | Result |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| DNA | A, C, G, T | All life |
| Neurons | Weighted sum, nonlinearity, integrate, fire | Intelligence |
| Analog Circuits | Summation, integration, nonlinearity, events | All signal processing |
| Digital Logic | NAND gates (or AND, OR, NOT) | All computation |
| Unix | Pipes, files, processes | Operating systems |
| Moog Synth | VCO, VCF, VCA, envelopes | Music |

**Your platform follows the same pattern.**

## The Four Core Operations

Everything in analog and digital signal processing reduces to:

## How These Four Build Everything

### Filters

### Neural Networks
- **Summation** (weighted inputs) + **Nonlinearity** (activation) + **Integration** (recurrent state)

### Physical Models
- **Integration** (differential equations) + **Nonlinearity** (contact, friction) + **Summation** (forces)

### Reverb
- **Integration** (delays/resonators) + **Summation** (mix taps) + **Nonlinearity** (soft saturation)

### Chaos Generators
- **Integration** (state evolution) + **Nonlinearity** (feedback) + **Summation** (coupling)

## Module Taxonomy Based on Primitives

Your platform should offer modules that implement these primitives cleanly:

### Essential Module Set (4-6 blocks)

1. **SumBlock**
   - Analog: Op-amp summer, mixer
   - Digital: Adder, combiner
   - Use: Mix sources, feed-forward, gain staging

2. **IntegratorBlock**
   - Analog: RC integrator, OTA filter
   - Digital: IIR/FIR filter
   - Use: Filters, envelopes, oscillators, resonators

3. **NonlinearBlock**
   - Analog: Diode clipper, transistor saturation
   - Digital: Waveshaper, sigmoid
   - Use: Distortion, compression, activation functions

4. **TriggerBlock**
   - Analog: Comparator, S&H
   - Digital: Clock, gate generator
   - Use: Modulation, timing, events, resets

5. **ControlBlock** (Optional)
   - CV input/output
   - Parameter routing
   - Macro controls

6. **UtilityBlock** (Optional)
   - Buffers
   - Inverters
   - Splitters
   - Level shifters

## Why This Approach Works

### 1. **Keeps the System Simple**
Don't build 50 module types. Build 4-6 primitives.
Everything else is composition.

### 2. **Enables Emergent Complexity**
Like DNA: simple alphabet → infinite combinations.

### 3. **Substrate Agnostic**
Primitives work whether implemented in:
- Analog circuits
- DSP chips
- Neural accelerators
- Hybrid systems

### 4. **Educational Power**
Users learn the fundamentals by composing primitives.
They understand WHY things work, not just WHAT they do.

### 5. **Future-Proof**
New exotic substrates (optical, biological, quantum) will still implement these same operations.

## The Anti-Pattern: Don't Overbuild

**DON'T create:**
- "J-45 Body Model Block"
- "Tube Preamp Block"
- "Vintage Tape Saturator Block"
- "Specific Plugin Emulation Block"

**DO create:**
- Primitives that COMPOSE into those behaviors

**Why:**
- Fewer modules to maintain
- More creative possibilities
- Users build their own "J-45" from primitives
- Ecosystem stays lean and hackable
- Third parties innovate within your framework

## Comparison to Other Systems

| System | Primitives | Composable? | Result |
|--------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| DNA | 4 bases | ✅ | All life |
| Unix | Pipes + files | ✅ | Infinite tools |
| Moog | VCO/VCF/VCA/ENV | ✅ | Modular synthesis |
| Eurorack | 1000s of modules | ❌ | Confusion & redundancy |
| Your Platform | 4-6 primitives | ✅ | **Emergent complexity** |

**Eurorack failed to define primitives.**
They have hundreds of modules that often do redundant things.
Users are overwhelmed.

**Your platform succeeds by staying focused on primitives.**

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Primitives (MVP)
Build 4 modules:
1. SumBlock
2. IntegratorBlock
3. NonlinearBlock
4. TriggerBlock

Prove the concept. Show composition works.

### Phase 2: Control Layer
Add:
5. ControlBlock (CV routing, macro knobs)
6. UtilityBlock (buffers, splitters)

Enable richer modulation and routing.

### Phase 3: Advanced Implementations
Offer multiple versions of each primitive:
- IntegratorBlock_Analog (op-amp RC)
- IntegratorBlock_DSP (IIR filters)
- IntegratorBlock_Neural (analog capacitor network)

Users pick the implementation that fits their needs.

### Phase 4: Composite Modules (User-Defined)
Once primitives are established, users create composite modules:
- "MyCustomFilter" = IntegratorBlock + NonlinearBlock + SumBlock
- Save as preset or share as community module
